1. Two variables that correlate (move together across time, for example) does not imply that a change in variable 1 causes a variable 2, vice versa.

    One situation where people slip into confusing correlation and causality is in regression. For example, one might regress college GPA on SAT scores, 
    obtaining a positive coefficient beta of SAT score in the regression equation. 
    
    Consider the following two statements:
        An increase of one point in SAT scores causes, on average, an increase of β points in college GPA.
        For every increase of one point in SAT scores, the increase in average college GPA is β points.
        
    Statement B is correct (assuming, of course, that the regression has been carried out correctly). Statement A is incorrect: the regression equation 
    gives no information about causality. Indeed, there is likely a lurking variable (or probably a bunch of lurking variables) that affects both GPA and 
    SAT score; SAT score is considered to be a (perhaps crude) measure 1of this lurking variable.
